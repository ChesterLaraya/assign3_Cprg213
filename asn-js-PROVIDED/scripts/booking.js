// when the day buttons are clicked, we will apply the "clicked" class to that element, and update any other relevant variables. Then, we can recalculate the total cost.

/********* change rate *********/
// when the half-day button is clicked, set the daily rate to $20, add the "clicked" class to the "half" element, remove it from the "full" element, and recalculate the total cost.




// when the full-day button is clicked, the daily rate is set back to $35, the clicked class is added to "full" and removed from "half", and the total cost is recalculated.
